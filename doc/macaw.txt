Global~

yc
    Open *Macaw* with the syntax group under the cursor.

Buffer-local~

g?
    Show this help.

q 
    Close the plugin window.

[count]<c-a> 
    Increment by [count] the number (0-255) of the color employed for the
    selected syntax group.

[count]<c-x>
    Decrement by [count] the number (0-255) of the color employed for the
    selected syntax group.

<Left>
    Cycle between red->blue->green->red. The currently selected color, which
    is written in the status line of the plugin window, can then be modified
    with <Up> and <Down>.

<Right>
    Cycle between red->green->blue->red.  The currently selected color, which
    is written in the status line of the plugin window, can then be modified
    with <Up> and <Down>.

<Down>
    Decrement either red, blue, or green.

<Up>
    Increment either red, blue, or green.

!
    This requires the program 'grabc' to be installed on your system.
    It uses 'grabc' to fetch an external color, which is then approximated
    using the terminal colors.
B
    Toggle between foreground and background. The current value value of this
    parameter is written in the status line of the plugin window.

T
    Toggle between vertical and horizontal mode. To make either layout
    persistent, change |g:macaw_orientation|.

I
    Toggle between synID and translated synID. To illustrate the use of this,
    let us consider two text files that both contain only one line.

    *test.vim* : >
        let a = 1729
<
    *test.py* : >
        a = 1729
<
    With default vim settings, the number 1729 in *test.vim* is in the syntax
    group 'vimNumber', whereas the number 1729 in *test.py*  is in the syntax
    group 'pythonNumber'.

    Both of these groups link to the group 'Number', which means that the
    highlight rules of the group Number are employed for highlighting
    numbers in both files. The group 'Number' is said to be the translated
    syntax group of both 'vimNumber' and 'pythonNumber'; see |synIDtrans()| for
    more details on this.

    When *Macaw* is called with the cursor on 1729 in 'test.vim', it assumes
    by default that the syntax group you want to tweak is 'Number', not
    'vimNumber': a change of color will apply to all the syntax groups that
    link to 'Number', which includes 'pythonNumber'.

    If you want to tweak the highlighting of only the 'vimNumber' syntax
    group, just press *I* in the *Macaw* buffer.
